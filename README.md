## Installation

```
npm install --save timeseries-3d
```

## Usage

* This package provides 2 components: a `ModelEditor` and a `Timeseries3D` component, which visualises the model and any data provided.
* The `ModelEditor` allows to create different layers of a 3D model using a floorplan-like editor for each layer.
    * The model editor allows to import and export the model as JSON file
* Data for the `Timeseries3D` can be provided in 2 ways: as JSON object providing single values for each component OR as JSON object with list of values and corresponding timestamps for each component.
    * If no data is provided, the component will simply render the model

### Step 1 - Create a Model (`ModelEditor`)

1. Use the "+" bar at the bottom to add new layers. Click on a layer to expand it.
2. Click "+ Add Components" to open the component form. You can either add single component identifiers or generate a series of them.
3. Once you've generated a set of component identifiers, you can select a component (focus) and start drawing rectangles on the canvas. 
 As soon as components are drawn, the focus will move to the next component. Additional components will snap to the guidelines that are
 generated as you draw components. Additionally a component will snap to the width/height of the previously create component when close.
4. You can export the model as JSON file. Layers are provided in order from bottom to top.

```javascript
import { ModelEditor } from "timeseries-3d"

const MyReactComponent = () => <ModelEditor />
```

**Example of a model**

```json
{
    "layers": [
        {
            "components": [
                { "x": 151, "y": 69, "size": [107, 25], "id": "WA001" },
                { "x": 151, "y": 94, "size": [107, 25], "id": "WA002" }
            ],
            "height": 50,
            "label": "Bottom Layer"
        },
        {
            "components": [
                { "x": 180, "y": 205, "size": [29, 87], "id": "PA001" },
                { "x": 209, "y": 205, "size": [29, 87], "id": "PA002" }
            ],
            "height": 60
        }
    ]
}
```

### Step 2 - Visualise the Model

1. You can either use the "Show Preview" section at the bottom of the `ModelEditor` or simply embed a `Timeseries3D` element with just 
 the `model` property provided:

```javascript
import { ModelEditor, Timeseries3D } from "timeseries-3d"

const model = { layers: [...] }  // this is your model as generated by the editor
const MyReactComponent = () => <ModelEditor model={demoModel} />
const MyOtherReactComponent = () => <Timeseries3D model={demoModel} />
```

### Step 3a - Visualise a Single Data Point

Provide the data as `data` property to the `Timeseries3D`. The data structure is a flat JSON object with keys for each component 
 identifiers and the value to represent.

**Example**

```javascript
import { Timeseries3D } from "timeseries-3d"

const data = {
    "WA001": 31.3,
    "WA002": 27.4,
    "PA001": 19.8,
    "PA002": 26.9
}
const model = { layers: [...] }  // this is your model as generated by the editor
const MyReactComponent = () => <Timeseries3D model={model} data={data} />
```

### Step 3b - Visualise a Time Series

Provide the data as `data` property to the `Timeseries3D`. The data structure is a JSON object with a `"timestamps"` and `"values"` key. The
 `"timestamps"` is a simple array of Unix timestamps, the `"values"` is a JSON object with keys for each component. Underneath each key is an 
 array of numeric values that correspond to the `"timestamps"` in the same order.

**Example**

```javascript
import { Timeseries3D } from "timeseries-3d"

const data = {
    "timestamps": [1618794000, 1618794060, 1618794120],
    "values": {
        "WA001": [19.6, 20.2, 21.0],
        "WA002": [31.8, 32.5, 32.5],
        "PA001": [26.1, 27.0, 27.9],
        "PA002": [28.0, 27.0, 26.1]
    }
}

const model = { layers: [...] }  // this is your model as generated by the editor
const MyReactComponent = () => <Timeseries3D model={model} data={data} autoplay />
```

## Properties

### Timeseries3D

**Required Parameters**

- `model` - the model to render

**Optional Parameters (Model)**

- `width` - the width in pixel of the rendering - default `900`
- `height` - the height in pixel of the rendering - default `700`
- `layerGap` - the gap in pixel to render in between layers - default `10`
- `noFilters` - whether filtering the rendering by layer or component ID and adjusting  
 transparency is hidden or not - default `false`
- `transparency` - the initial transparency for the components between 0.0 (opaque) and 0.95 (transparent) - default `0.4`

**Optional Parameters (Data)**

- `data` - a JSON object containing the values to render. This can either be a flat list
 of values or list of values - default `null`.
- `minValue` - provide a minimum value that defines the bottom end of the colour scale. 
 Values below will be rendered with the colour representing the minimum value - default 
 _will be determined automatically from the data_
- `maxValue` - provide a maximum value that defines the upper end of the colour scale. 
 Values above will be renderedc with the colour representing the maximum value - default
 _will be determined automatically from the data_
- `colors` - an array of 3 colours, each colour provided as an array of 3 integers 
 representing the RGB values - default `[[248, 105, 107], [255, 255, 255], [90, 138, 198]]` 
  (red -> white -> blue)
- `inverse` - inverses the colour representation of the min/max value - default `false`
- `timestampFormat` - whether the timestamps are provided as seconds, milliseconds or 
 nanoseconds (`"s"`, `"ms"`, `"ns"`) - default `"s"`
- `autoplay` - if time-series data is provided, this will indicate whether to  
 automatically start playing - default `false`
- `dateFormat` - if time-series data is provided, this will provide the momentjs format
 to render the timestamp in the player bar - default `"LLL"`
- `playbackSpeed` - the delay in milliseconds between frames during playback - default `500`

**Full Example**

```javascript
import { Timeseries3D } from "timeseries-3d"

const data = {
    "timestamps": [1618794000000, 1618794060000, 1618794120000],
    "values": {
        "WA001": [19.6, 20.2, 21.0],
        "WA002": [31.8, 32.5, 32.5],
        "PA001": [26.1, 27.0, 27.9],
        "PA002": [28.0, 27.0, 26.1]
    }
}

const model = { layers: [...] }  // this is your model as generated by the editor
const MyReactComponent = () => (
    <Timeseries3D 
        model={model} 
        data={data}
        autoplay 
        playbackSpeed={1000}
        timestampFormat="ms"
        dateFormat="hh:mm"
        inverse
        minValue={20.0}
        maxValue={25.0}
        colors={[[180, 30, 30], [160, 160, 70], [30, 180, 30]]}
        width={1024}
        height={768}
        transparency={0.1}
        layerGap={0}
        noFilters        
    />
)
```

This will render the component with the provided data:

- the time series will automatically playback with 1000ms between frames
- the timestamps are provided in milliseconds and they will be rendered using the "hh:mm" 
 (hour:minute) date format
- the values will be rendered on an inverted red -> yellow -> green colour scale (highest values 
 are red, lowest are green) within the range of 20.0 (green) to 25.0 (red)
- the rendering will be 1024px wide and 768px high, componens will be very opaque (0.1) and there
 will be no gaps between layers and no ability to show/hide layers or adjust transparency.

### ModelEditor

**Optional Parameters**

- `height` - the height of the layout editor for each layer - default `450`
- `model` - optional - the model to initialise the editor with
